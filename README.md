Chocolate Keen Dreams (currently based on Keen Dreams CGA v1.05 only)
=====================================================================

This is a port of a Keen Dreams release originally compatible with the CGA
(so basically just 4 distinct colors are used for the graphics).

Note that it does not come with a copy of the game, which is required.
It currently aims to be a replacement executable for Keen Dreams CGA v1.05.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the README.md file of the original Keen Dreams source code release

files, which you must still legally acquire.  This includes the static data

Why CGA graphics
----------------

As a possible preparation for Commander Keen 4-6, some engine code considered
to be shared with these was originally ported from the Catacomb 3D source code
(https://github.com/FlatRockSoft/Catacomb3D), with no actual testing.
CGA routines were preferred, given possible complications with the EGA
bit planes and multiple read/write modes. Later, this assisted with
the porting of Keen Dreams CGA.

--------------
Current status
--------------

- The mouse can be used for control panel navigation, while the keyboard is
usable basically everywhere.
- Basic joystick support is in, although it's kind-of similar to the DOS days
so it doesn't remind of more recent titles.
- AdLib and PC Speaker sound emulations are in. AdLib emulation is possible
thanks to the DBOPL emulator from DOSBox.
- CGA graphics and text mode emulation (on an emulated VGA adapter).
- Game is playable using a 64-bit Linux executable (tested on Ubuntu 14.04),
as well as a 32-bit Windows executable, but it hasn't yet been entirely tested.
New non-vanilla bugs are possible!
- There should be compatibility with the configuration file as generated by the
original DOS executable, but this hasn't been tested.
- Saved game compatibility is implemented (with Keen Dreams CGA v1.05 only),
but there can still be some new non-vanilla bugs.

---------------
Making this run
---------------

This requires Keen Dreams CGA v1.05. On Windows, you should simply drop
the files SDL2.dll and chocolate-keen-dreams-cga.exe together with the files
coming with the original game, and then launch chocolate-keen-dreams-cga.exe.
Furthermore, you may optionally copy any of the bundled .bat files.

------------------------------------------------
How to do *this and that* or: Configuration file
------------------------------------------------

On first launch of Chocolate Keen Dreams, a configuration file
named chocolate-keen-dreams.cfg should be generated. You can
edit it to fit your needs. Currently available settings:
- "fullscreen" toggle. Value should be either "true" or "false".
- "fullres" for fullscreen window resolution. By default the value is "0x0",
implying desktop resolution, but it can be any other (but supported)
specific resolution, say (under some setups) "1024x768".
- "windowres" is similar, but for non-fullscreen windows. The default of "0x0"
refers to dimensions which are kind-of proportional to the desktop's.
- "displaynum" may be useful if you have multiple monitors,
but it's totally untested as of now.
- "sdlrenderer" lets you pick software rendering if you wish. Value should be
"auto" for hardware accelerated rendering (if supported) and "software"
for the other choice.
Note: Technically at least one more value should be acceptable,
but the values given above probably suffice for now.
- "vsync" lets you toggle Sync to VBlank. Valid values are "auto", "off", "on".
Currently the default of "auto" implies "off", since this is probably the case
with the original Keen Dreams CGA and real CGA/EGA/VGA hardware.
- "bilinear" toggles bilinear filtering. Valid values are "true" and "false".
If set to "true", consider taking a look at the "scalefactor" setting.
- "scaletype" can be used to toggle aspect ratio correction. Good e.g.,
in case screen burn-in is a concern. Valid values are "aspect" and "fill".
- "scalefactor" can be used for two-step scaling. When different from 1, and
with "bilinear=true", on compatible hardware the game's graphical contents to
be displayed should first be zoomed in each dimension by the given scale
factor, and then the zoomed pic should be scaled to the window with bilinear
filtering applied. This is done so scaling artifacts coming from non-bilinear
interpolation are less noticeable, while the output is not too blurry.
- "autolock" tells if the window should have full control of the mouse
(setting has no effect for fullscreen windows). Even if disabled, the cursor
should be hidden while in the middle of the window. Valid values are "true"
and "false".
- "sndsamplerate" lets you specify a sound sample rate (in Hz).Currently the
default is 49716, which is close to the rate of OPL chips generating AdLib
sounds. It's also more efficient, as no interpolation is required, since the
rate of 49716Hz is used for AdLib emulation internally.

--------------------
There is some bug...
--------------------

This is still new, and bugs tend to happen in the porting process.
But, if it's rather a bug found in the original game which is reproduced,
most chances are it won't be fixed, since Chocolate Keen Dreams aims to
preserve behaviors of an original release, including bugs, at least if it's not
too difficult (e.g., anything that highly depends on the memory layout).

-----------------------------------------------
Building Chocolate Keen Dreams from the sources
-----------------------------------------------

- Development files for SDL 2.0 are required, as well as GNU make and the
GNU Compiler Collection's C compiler (i.e. gcc). In practice, at the moment
only "make" and "gcc" are probably required. If nothing goes wrong, a
single "make" command should build the executable. "make clean" removes any
generated object or executable file, assuming the *exact* same arguments have
been passed to "make" as before, with the exception of "clean".
- MinGW can be used as well (tested on Linux). If you try to cross-compile
then you may wish to set PLATFORM=WINDOWS and BINPREFIX accordingly.

Changelog
---------

Oct 3, 2014 (v0.8.2):
- Bilinear filtering can now be toggled on if hardware acceleration is in use.
- In case off-screen rendering is supported, it can be used for two-step
scaling of the graphical output: First nearest-neighbor interpolation with
the added "scalefactor" setting, and then bilinear.
- Sync to VBlank can be manually toggled now (if supported on the used setup).
By default "vsync=auto" is used, currently implying "off" (with CGA graphics).
- Live sound interpolation has been implemented, and it's possible to specify
a different sound sample rate, while the rate used for OPL emulation is still
49716Hz. Currently 49716 is the default value
- Fixed a bug: One cfg setting or more not written to file when it's expected.
- As of this version, the cfg file is (re)written on launch. This is done so
new settings can appear in the file if it's not up-to-date.

Sep 29 2014 (v0.8.1):
- Compatibility with saved games from vanilla Keen Dreams CGA v1.05 is in. As expected, it can still be buggy (in fact, vanilla Keen also has its limits/bugs with this).
- As a possibly indirect consequence, a vanilla Keen bug in StateMachine/DoActor leading to a crash in Chocolate Keen Dreams has been found (NULL pointer dereference). Workaround is applied now.
- The environment variables from last release are gone. Instead, you should have the configuration file chocolate-keen-dreams.cfg to fiddle with (created on launch if it doesn't exist).
- Custom fullscreen and windowed resolutions can be set in the configuration file. Furthermore, aspect correction can be toggled off (e.g., in case screen burn-in is a concern).
- Mouse cursor lock can be toggled off (from the cfg). By default the cursor is now unlocked in a non-fullscreen window. Chances are the behaviors may still feel a bit off, but at least we have that.
- Loading window with bars should display (while loading a map), although it's shown for about a short moment on sufficiently fast machines.

Sep 26 2014 (v0.8.0):
- Initial release, based on Keen Dreams CGA v1.05. Should be playable with
sound effects and CGA graphics on Linux and Windows desktops. Game saving and
more is totally untested and may be incompatible with original data generated
by the corresponding DOS executable (saved games are known to be incompatible).
